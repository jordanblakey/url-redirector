## User Facing

*   Resolved issues with the badge timer display, improving the accuracy of status indicators.

## Technical Highlights
*   Underwent a significant overhaul of the testing infrastructure, including migration to Vitest, CI optimization, and removal of redundant E2E tests.

*   Reverted the primary storage mechanism from `chrome.storage.sync` back to `chrome.storage.local` to resolve identified bugs and flaky test behavior.
*   Improved codebase quality and security by adding missing type annotations, removing dead code, and addressing several CodeQL security alerts.
