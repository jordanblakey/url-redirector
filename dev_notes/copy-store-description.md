## Store Description - Emotional

Caught you looking.

URL Redirector is your benevolent internet bouncer—catching those "just a quick check" moments and gently yeeting you back to focus. 

You know the drill: you're working, then suddenly you're 47 tabs deep into a Reddit thread about whether hot dogs are sandwiches. We've all been there. This extension intercepts those impulse navigations and redirects you anywhere you want—a blank page, a focus playlist, a reminder of your goals, whatever works.

How it works:
Set up custom redirect rules (twitter.com → your to-do list, reddit.com → literally anywhere else). When your fingers autopilot to a distraction site, the extension catches you and bounces you to safety. Each rule tracks how many times it's saved you—sometimes the number is... revealing.

Features:
Custom redirect rules for any URL
Pause/resume rules without deleting them
Playful, randomized feedback that keeps things fresh
All data stays local on your device

No judgment, no lectures—just a friendly redirect when you need it. Take back your attention, one intervention at a time.

Brand Identity: Your ADHD Best Friend Who Sends You 47 Memes at 2am

The extension is a chaotic good companion - think golden retriever energy meets internet gremlin. It communicates through wild microcopy that changes every time: sometimes it's your supportive life coach ("You're doing amazing, bestie! 🌟"), sometimes it's unhinged ("BEGONE, DEMON WEBSITE 👹"), sometimes it's just... weird ("This redirect brought to you by the concept of Tuesday"). No corporate-speak, no boring confirmations - just vibes, emojis, and the kind of friend who'd physically grab your phone out of your hands at a party because "you've been doomscrolling for 20 minutes and there's cake." The UI itself stays clean and functional, but every interaction is sprinkled with personality that keeps users delightfully off-balance in the best way.
